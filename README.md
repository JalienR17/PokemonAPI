My Pok√©mon API project is an interactive and dynamic web application that pulls data from an extensive Pok√©mon dataset, 
giving users an engaging experience. On the home page, I‚Äôve implemented a visually appealing card system that loops 
through an array of over 1,000 Pok√©mon, displaying their images, names, and abilities dynamically. The looping 
mechanism ensures that users can seamlessly browse the collection, making the interface smooth and responsive.
I‚Äôve also enhanced the functionality by integrating an ability section, allowing users to explore the unique traits of 
each Pok√©mon. The addition of a structured Bootstrap navbar‚Äîincluding a hamburger menu‚Äîimproves navigation across 
different screen sizes. My attention to detail in refining JavaScript interactions shows my growing proficiency in 
handling API data, manipulating the DOM, and optimizing user experience.
This project reflects my technical growth and creativity‚Äîit‚Äôs a solid step toward mastering front-end development. 
The experience has sharpened my skills and boosted my confidence in JavaScript.

Objective:
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript Objects, the DOM, and asynchronous 
JavaScript by creating a simple web page that interacts with the PokeAPI to display basic Pok√©mon information. 
his exercise will help you practice fetching data from an API and dynamically updating the webpage.Instructions:
1. 
Create an input box where users can type the name or ID of a Pok√©mon.
Add a button that triggers the search when clicked.
Use the PokeAPI to fetch Pok√©mon data asynchronously.
When the search is triggered, make an API request to retrieve the Pok√©mon's information.
3. Display Data:
Display the Pok√©mon's name and image on the page after fetching the data.
Update the DOM dynamically based on the API response.
4. Basic Error Handling:
If the Pok√©mon is not found, display a simple error message.
Bonus (Optional):
Display the Pok√©mon's type (e.g., Fire, Water) along with its name and image.
Technical Requirements:
Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
Fetch Pok√©mon data using the Fetch API or async/await.
Dynamically update the DOM with the Pok√©mon data.
Deliverables:
A working web page that allows users to search for a Pok√©mon and displays its name and image.
Evaluation Criteria:
The app should successfully fetch and display Pok√©mon data.
Clean and readable code.
Simple, functional interface with appropriate feedback for invalid searches.
Submission:
Create a GitHub repository with the solution of the assignment and submit the link in Google Classroom.
